# bdayMessage

We are all busy with our lives and sometimes birthday messages go amiss.
I recently learned about web scraping and then doing some research into that. With looking into that, I thought there must be a way to run a script that will automate birthday messages.

So I am going to use this script:

To run the script you need to have `Python3` installed.

I would suggest that you have your chrome driver in the local folder to the script.

There needs to be installed:
`selenium` which can be installed with `pip3 selenium`
`datetime` which can be installed with `datetime`

The json files format must be:
`[ { "name": "Jason Beedle", "birth_month": "12", "birth_date": "10" }, ]`
